SERVER-12006 - Fixed potential pointer overflow leading to an infinit…
…e loop in

db/storage/record.cpp

In order to iterate over the data in the record there was a previous loop that
compared pointers. This will not work as expected because the addr pointer may
overflow.

In C, it is undefined behavior to increment a pointer (in this case addr) more
than 1 past the end of the array (in this case _data) to which it points.

If the compiler so chooses, it may wrap around the pointer if it increases past
a_data + SliceSize + 1. This would cause this loop to never exit because addr
would always be less than end.
