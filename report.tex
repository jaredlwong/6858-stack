\title{Uncovering Undefined Behavior}
\author{Eric Lubin, Jared Wong}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Overview}
In this project we study the effects of undefined behavior in open source software
and its ability to cause unstable code to be optimized out by modern compilers.

Given the sheer number of software systems that contain such errors, 
with about 50\% of Debian packages reporting over 80,000 different warnings,
we attempted to begin the process of filtering through these results. 

With the help of STACK\cite{stack}, we analyzed \NumPackages packages, 
from Debian and other locations, and submitted a total of \NumPatches patches, 
of which \NumPatchesAccepted have been accepted thus far, with the rest pending approval.
This paper presents a case study into the common mis-practices of many developers and
has helped us develop a rule-of-humb heuristic as to which types of bugs are more
or less likely to be vulnerabilities.

In section~\ref{sec:threat} we review the threat model, in section~\ref{sec:classification}
we break down the observed bugs into a number of different categories that loosely 
correspond to the the types of bugs STACK can detect, and in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}
we wrap up and discuss future areas of research. Finally, section~\ref{sec:appendix} provides an 
appendix of all patches found and submitted thus far.

\section{Threat Model}
\label{sec:threat}
We assume that an attacker has complete knowledge of the source code in question. Any 
optimization unsafe bugs that exist they are able to find and exploit if there is any entry point.

\section{Classification of Unstable Code}
\label{sec:classification}
Generally, the bugs we found due to unstable code fell into several
main categories. First, null pointer dereferences were the  most common type of 
bug signaled by STACK but did not alter correctness. Mixed in with these null pointer dereferences
were actual programmer errors due to accidentally not dereferencing pointers for which
they wanted their value. Second, signed integer operation overflow checks were another common source
of developer misconception. Thirdly, there were pointer overflow bugs. And finally, there were a class
of miscellaneous bugs related to division by zero, buffer overflow by one, and shift left and right overflow.


\subsection{Null Pointer Dereference}
Null pointer dereference, caused by checks to ensure that pointer is not null,
but pointer is never not null at location. True result optimized out.

\subsection{Signed Integer Operation Overflow}

\subsection{Programmer Error}

\subsection{Argument Checking}

Order of positions matter, can cause overflow if in wrong order. Accessing out of bounds memory, shifting right and left


\section{Exploits}
Some random exploits

\section{Patches}
Some of our patches

\begin{lstlisting}
n = e - i + 1;  /* number of elements */
if (n <= 0 || !lua_checkstack(L, n))
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Overall, we have shown the value that STACK brings to the suite of static checkers available to 
developers to verify the correctness and stability of their code. STACK can even present warnings
to the developer that catch simple careless error where certain pointers are not dereferenced, as
was the case with Subversion and Audacity. 

Nonetheless, we have noticed the difficulty with discovering legitimate exploits based on these
undefined behavior bugs. Amidst countless redundant null pointer dereferences, many such bugs
are hidden numerous levels deep from the outwards facing components in these packages. As a result,
the ability to propagate an invalid input into such a bug and then exploit this bug is highly challenging. 

In the future, we hope to take this research further. In particular, we'd like to analyze more large
scale packages such as the llvm, julia, and latex packages. Given the time and processor constraints
of this project and the slight difficulty we had in compiling llvm in the first place for using
with stack, we would like to be able to devote more time into such an endeavor. Furthermore, while we liked
having access to all the Debian packages having already been analyzed by STACK, we spent a lot of our time
building other packages andsuppressing compiler warnings instead of analyzing pstack reports. 
In the past week, we have discussed writing a harness into \texttt{brew install} in order to get STACK
results on a much larger variety of packages. Furthermore, we want to focus on existing bugs to attempt
to continue on our quest for exploitable, public facing bugs..
