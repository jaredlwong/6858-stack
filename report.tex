\title{Exploiting Undefined Behavior}

\section{Overview}
In this project we study the effects of undefined behavior in open source
software. In particular, we focus on code with undefined behavior which may
lead to incorrect outputs, or which could compromise a system.

In order to study undefined behavior we use Stack\cite{stack} which finds undefined
behavior by finding code that may be optimized out by compilers.

We define several categories of behavioral patterns associated with undefined
behavior: redundant checks, 

\section{Threat Model}
We assume that an attacker has complete knowledge of the source code.

\section{Classification of Undefined Behavior Bugs}
Generally, the bugs we found due to undefined behavior fell into several
general categories.

Null pointer dereference, caused by checks to ensure that pointer is not null,
but pointer is never not null at location. True result optimized out.

\section{Exploits}
Some random exploits
